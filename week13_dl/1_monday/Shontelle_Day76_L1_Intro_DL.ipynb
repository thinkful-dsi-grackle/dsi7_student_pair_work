        "Deep networks outperform shallow networks because of computational time and number of parameters. Many layers contain multiple non-linear transformations, which means that they are able to model more complex behavior. Deep-learning models are very successful at discovering useful features from complex data, such as image, video, and text. The magic of these models is their feature-engineering capabilities. One of the main advantages of deep learning is in the modelâ€™s ability to perform automated feature engineering. Shallow networks only have input and output layers with no iteration process. \n",

# dsi7_student_pair_work

## Purpose

Public repo to turn in pair exercises during our Data Science Immersive course.

## Instructions

Push your pair exercise notebooks (or other filetypes when appropriate) into the current week folder, using a file name with your pair's names in it. Make sure to use your names so you don't overwrite someone else's file.

## Example

```
cd dsi7_student_pair_work
mv python_practice_eda_alessandro_eniola_elizabeth.ipynb week01_python_statistics
git add week01_python_statistics/
git commit -m 'EDA assignment'
git pull
git push
```

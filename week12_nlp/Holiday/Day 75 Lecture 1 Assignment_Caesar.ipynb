Explain What Is Sqlite Transactions? Answer :The transaction is referred as a unit of work that is performed against a database. It is the propagation of one or more changes to the database. Properties of transactions are determined by ACID.  Atomicity: It ensures that all work unit are successfully completed. Consistency: It ensures that the database changes states upon a successfully committed transaction. Isolation: It enables transactions to operate independently of and transparent to each other. Durability: It ensures that the result or effect of a committed transaction persists in case of a system failure.   Question 1. Explain What Is Sqlite Transactions?

Answer : Using transactions we can group all SQL commands into a single unit. The transaction begins with some task and finishes only when all tasks within it are over. The transaction gets over successfully only when all commands in it are successfully over. Even if one command fails, the whole transaction fails. The BEGIN TRANSACTION, ROLLBACK TRANSACTION, and COMMIT TRANSACTION statements are used to work with transactions. A group of tasks starts with the begin statement. In case of any problem, the rollback command is executed to abort the transaction. If all the tasks run successfully, all commands are executed through commit statement.   Question 16.

The transaction gets over successfully only when all commands in it are successfully over. Even if one command fails, the whole transaction fails. The BEGIN TRANSACTION, ROLLBACK TRANSACTION, and COMMIT TRANSACTION statements are used to work with transactions. A group of tasks starts with the begin statement. In case of any problem, the rollback command is executed to abort the transaction. If all the tasks run successfully, all commands are executed through commit statement.   ',\n"," 'List Out The Standard Sql Lite Commands? ',\n"," 'The standard SQL Lite commands interact with relational databases are similar to SQL. They are  SELECT CREATE INSERT UPDATE DROP DELETE  Based on their operational nature these commands can be classified.  ',\n"," 'Define The \"integrity Rules\"?

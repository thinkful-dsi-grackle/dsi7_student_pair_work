I get that language syntax and explicit keywords is a must for smart compiler but how come there is no something good that enables C safety in compile time? Like adding some custom keywords while maintaining compatibility with bare C? Logically, there would be an attempt at this of which I am not aware, but still, how did it not become massive enough(relatively to Rust, how it gained popularity with safety + performance)
This question is not aimed at roots of C but why it did not evolve in this direction. I was wondering, is there a flavor of C which guarantees safety, and if there is, why is not it as popular as rustUpdate: also, what would be main problem in taking goodness of rust and putting it in Câ€™s new compiler

I am working for a publicly traded company. I have been spending the past 9 months alone in my apartment in Europe and it's driving me crazy. Having been recently separated has aggravated the effects.I am hoping to work from a SEA country for 2.5 months. My employer is publicly traded.I have already asked my manager about it and while he himself is unconcerned, the HR Policy is that they are not able to allow more than two weeks of work from another country. Any more will entail that I go on vacation, unpaid leave or be terminated.I am hoping to avoid the latter scenarios entirely. I have to do what I have to do to take care of my mental health. And my management and company has to do what they have to do to keep their hands clear of legal liability.I am working out how I can work in another countryI have a Macbook Pro 15'' 2016 model. I have an USB-c extension port set that has aLet's set aside the whole question around my visa in this new country. A friend of mine recently worked outside of a European country for couple of months and has already received an email from his employer's legal department. I am inclined to think this is a reality of working for a publicly traded company.I am looking for a technical solution to create no record of the corporate VPN seeing that I am in the SEA country. How do I do that?This is what I have so far:I will use Wifi to connect a Windows mini-PC to whatever WiFi I have access to. I will then use that Wifi to tunnel my internet to the European country I live in. I will share the tunnelled internet via Ethernet and connect the Macbook Pro to that Ethernet and let the corporate tunnel through my tunneled internet. I will turn off WiFi entirely and make sure to never turn it on lest they discover ambient SSIDs and discover my location.Is this approach fool proof? Do you have a better idea?

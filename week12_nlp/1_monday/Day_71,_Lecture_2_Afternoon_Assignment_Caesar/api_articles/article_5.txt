Is there any app you're happy with 100%? I just can't find anything that fully satisfies my note-taking experience.1 - Evernote is too buggy, and it feels like every editor does different things, there is no consistency to it, and it seems so old and outdated2 - Notions web clipper sucks, doesn't pull italics correctly or numbered lists and app takes too long to load up...3 - OneNote has no sorting capabilities and can't clip .webp

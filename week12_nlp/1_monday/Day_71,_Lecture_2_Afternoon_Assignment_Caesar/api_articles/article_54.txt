This is a project tracking/announcement site that resembles the former Freshmeat:http://freshcode.club/It hasn't had a HN mention in six years:https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&query=freshcode&sort=byDate&type=storyDo you visit this site as a project consumer, looking for updates to existing project or new projects?Do you have projects whose releases you announce there?I used to faithfully announce projects on Freshmeat and when FM folded and Freshcode.club appeared, I moved moved there.I announced some 160 releases of TXR: on Freshcode.club:http://freshcode.club/projects/txrIs that a waste of time? The site shows its own stats, indicating around 5000 visitors per week. I remember that for the longest time that didn't work; it was pegged at zero.

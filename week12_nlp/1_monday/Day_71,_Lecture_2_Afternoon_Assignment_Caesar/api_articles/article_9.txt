What do you do with replaced hardware that still works perfectly fine?During the holidays and sales many of us might snag or be gifted a new laptop, phone or similar even though the current hardware works perfectly fine. In my case I got a nice laptop (i7, 16gb RAM) that was replaces recently, but I feel bad that it just lays here and age.What do you do with your no-longer-in-use hardware? Projects? Gifts? Charity?

The fact that targetteed ads are bad seems to be accepted as a given. However, in my naivit√© I struggle to grasp the rationale of this obvious truth. I hate all ads, but I kind of hate random, useless ads worse than potentially useful suggestions for products or services. Can someone help me please?

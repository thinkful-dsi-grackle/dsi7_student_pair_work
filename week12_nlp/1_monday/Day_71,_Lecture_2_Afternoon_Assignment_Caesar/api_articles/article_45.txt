Context: I consider myself a mid level engineer and I would love to watch senior+ engineers tackling problems in real time and explaining their thought process as they go along. I imagine pair programming resources would work too.There are tons of videos of people live coding on Youtube/Twitch but I find the majority of them often work on problems relatively trivial, do not explain their thought process very well or just don't write easy to read/modular code. Some examples of what I'd consider very high quality streams:Hacking with Andrew and Brad: an HTTP/2 client [0]Porting flamegraph to Rust [1][0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG-UaBJXZ80

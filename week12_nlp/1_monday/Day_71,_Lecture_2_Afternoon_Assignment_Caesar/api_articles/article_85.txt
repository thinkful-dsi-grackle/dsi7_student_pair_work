I consider myself below average when it comes to reading speed. getspread.com says right now that I am a 243 WPM (Words Per Minute) reader, and I've never seen that number go over the 250 WPM mark for myself.Granted the test might be flawed, but it's at least somewhat of an indication I guess.Despite reading a lot, although mostly articles, I can't seem to improve my reading speed in any way. I personally know people who can read well beyond the 600 WPM and even into the 700 WPM easily, but whom are not able to explain to me (let alone teach me) how they do it. It seems to be somewhat innate.How do I train myself to at least get into the 400 WPM range?Are there any courses or training material out there that worked for you?Were you a slow reader like me who managed to become faster?

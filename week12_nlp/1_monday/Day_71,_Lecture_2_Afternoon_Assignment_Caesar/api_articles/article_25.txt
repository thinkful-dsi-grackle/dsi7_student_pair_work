Does anybody have suggestions for apps or systems to organize reading materials? Eg. articles, papers, books and notes. Right now I use Pocket, but it's pretty much to read a quick article and throw it away. I've kept lists of papers/articles in Trello or Evernote, then I'll make notes in Evernote. I use Kindle to read books and then I translate highlights into light notes in Evernote. It's a bit of a pain though moving between the apps, and I've lost some faith in Evernote lately.I'm looking to organize and keep track of past articles and keep lists of things to read by categories. Before I invest more into the tagging/list features that Pocket has, I'm curious to see what other people do.

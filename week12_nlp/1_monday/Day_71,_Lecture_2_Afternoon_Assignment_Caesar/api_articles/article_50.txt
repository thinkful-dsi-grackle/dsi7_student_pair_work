Is there any research about memory efficiency of spoken languages that is collaboratively conducted by neuro and computer scientists?This may sound a little weird (and even stupid since I'm no expert in any of these fields)question, but it keeps my mind busy, occasionally. I tend to think there should be different "memory footprints" of languages - like languages with phonemic orthography[0] has much less memory footprint than non-phonemic ones.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic_orthography

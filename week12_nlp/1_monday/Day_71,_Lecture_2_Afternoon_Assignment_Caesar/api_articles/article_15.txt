It seems that every new [especially Saas] startup has a very similar "feeling" website. In terms of what to expect, fonts and colors used, even the feel of scrolling. Reminds me of Apple product pages from a few years ago. Are they using a common template or something?Some examples which go even further:https://www.productboard.com/https://savvycal.com/I can't imagine building something like this from scratch as an early founder. Any insight is much appreciated.

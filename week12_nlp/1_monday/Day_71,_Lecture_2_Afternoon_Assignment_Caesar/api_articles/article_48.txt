What I like about this time of year is that people tend to publish their predictions for the following year. While many of those predictions turn out to be comically wrong, I still find value in identifying some high level patterns in people's thinking.Can you think of any interesting new trends, or did you come across anyone else's that are worth sharing here? To somewhat narrow the scope, I would suggest that we focus on the tech industry (although that's very very broad these days).

TemporaryMail.com was created after struggling to find a working, secure and reliable service which provides temporary email addresses.
The goal is to keep this service as simple to use as possible - while also always providing a free option which does not require registration.Some of the features:
- Multiple domains to choose from, each with unique hostnames and IPs.- Support for inline images in emails.- Attachments are supported and can be downloaded.- Read your emails safely inside a sandbox (all external scripts disabled).- Read emails without automatically loading any external resources (you will first have to click on them and accept the dialog box).Feel free to have a look at the demo email: https://temporarymail.com/#demo@easyonlinemail.netAny feedback, question or bug report is greatly appreciated.

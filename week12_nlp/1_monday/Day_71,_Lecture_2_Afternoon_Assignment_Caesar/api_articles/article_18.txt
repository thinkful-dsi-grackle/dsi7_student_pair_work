I have a B.S. in Computer Science. Having worked two years, I've absolutely found i hate working under people in an office environment. I've hopped across three companies, I'm growing miserable and finding I dont enjoy this whole CRUD MVC business logic type of work. I'm tired of fixing leaking pipes in mediocre code bases by people who aren't passionate about what they do. I also find app development to be plain uninspiring and am constantly biting my tongue.I want to develop a JS interpreter, a simple game engine, or even an app of my own interests. Can these sort of projects lead to more distinguished roles? Or do I just have to work my way up for the next 20 years under bland government contractors and health insurance companies?This is not what I wanted in life. Do most people lie when asked if they like their job? People keep telling me to do what I live because bigger salaries aren't as important. That just doesn't seem realistic.

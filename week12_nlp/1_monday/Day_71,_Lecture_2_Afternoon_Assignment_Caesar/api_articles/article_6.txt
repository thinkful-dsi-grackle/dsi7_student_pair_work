For me a couple of interesting technology products that help me in my day-to-day job1. Hasura 2. Strapi 3. Forest Admin (super interesting although I cannot ever get it to connect to a hasura backend on Heroku ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 4. Integromat 5. AppgyverThere are many others that I have my eye on such as NodeRed[6], but have yet to use. I do realise that these are all low-code related, however, I would be super interested in being made aware of cool other cool & upcoming tech that is making waves.What's on your 'to watch' list?[1]https://hasura.io/[2]https://strapi.io/[3]https://www.forestadmin.com/[4]https://www.appgyver.com/[5]https://www.integromat.com/en[6]https://nodered.org/

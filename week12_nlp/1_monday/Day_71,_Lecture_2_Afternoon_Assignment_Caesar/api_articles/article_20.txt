I'm an experienced Django developer and I am trying build a modern looking website.I was trying to complete a React course on Udemy but realised that React (Webpack, Redux, Next, Hooks, etc.) may be an overkill and lead to lot of wasted dev time for my usecase. I have used jQuery previously and the application eventually devolved into spaghetti.Is there anything better than jQuery but not as complex as react and that integrates well with a backend like Django?

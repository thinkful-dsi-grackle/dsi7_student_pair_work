I know it's been a hard year for so many people, and there's so many families suffering and so many people deeply sad and in pain, this year, and around this time.When I reflect on all this, one thing that lets me feel more optimistic is focusing on what people are planning to do in the year ahead. What hopes and aspirations and goals they have.

I'm creating a new smartwatch.I will probably start with off-the-shelf hardware (PineTime?) and focus mainly on the OS/UI/UX. I plan to make everything open source.I'm looking for the opinion of experienced smartwatch users to better understand what a smartwatch should do.What's your favorite smartwatch?What do you like and dislike about existing smartwatches?What are the most useful and important features?What are unnecessary features and/or battery hogs?Describe the perfect smartwatch.

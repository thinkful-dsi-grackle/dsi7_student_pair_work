From Amazon, FedEx and the USPS, we've been receiving our neighbors' packages and mail. Our packages and mail can also end up at the home across the street from us. The buildings in our neighborhood are clearly marked and the street / mailing addresses pull up on map apps accurately. Yet the delivery drivers and mail carriers leave our deliveries at the door steps of others. We live in Los Angeles county; is this a problem where you live?

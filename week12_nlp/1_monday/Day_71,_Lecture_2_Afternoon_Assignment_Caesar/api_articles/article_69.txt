I look at the "newest" page every day at unpredictable times, and reasonably often I see something that has a minor error that's easily fixable, or make a comment that I hope would enable the poster/author to enhance the item in some way.Almost (but not quite always) invariably my comment goes unanswered, leading me to believe that either:(a) my input is not as helpful as it is intended to be, or(b) the poster/author isn't watching the submission.There may be other options, but I'm wondering ... how many people here operate in "fire and forget" mode?  The evidence suggests the proportion is substantial.Another option is that those who are not in "F&F" mode fix things and I don't see the erroneous version, so there is some selection bias, but even so, I'm curious.

Automerge &#8212; (Github) Data structure library for Javascript (and Rust) providing Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). Automerge is designed for creating local-first software, i.e. software that treats a user&#8217;s local copy of their data (on their own device) as primary, rather than centralising data in a cloud service. Alan Turing &#8212; (BBC) An excellent episode [&#8230;]

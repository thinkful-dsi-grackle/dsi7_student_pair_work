In your pair, create a markdown file answering the following:

Identify 3 scenarios in your everyday life where you use probability.
taking a walk in the park, changing my tolder diper, going to beach everyday.

Using the formula you learned to calculate probabilities, approximate the probabilities of the events in each of those 3 scenarios.
P(AB) = P(A) * P(B) 1. clear sky 3/10* schedule 5/10 = 7/10. 
Conditional = P(A|B) = P(AB)/P(B) 7/10 / 3/10 = 2.33

5/10 * 1/10= 6/10
6/10 / 5/10 = .12

3/10 * 1/10 = 4/10
4/10 / 1/10 = 4


Think about what potential dependencies the events in each of your 3 scenarios have. Calculate the joint probabilities for the events and their dependencies.
Calculate the conditional probabilities for the events given their dependencies.
one of the scenario like changing the dieper is depend on if he eats, sick and drinking water. walkingin the park is depend on the weather, schedule and priority. 
going to the beach depend if it's a work day and if the wethear good.

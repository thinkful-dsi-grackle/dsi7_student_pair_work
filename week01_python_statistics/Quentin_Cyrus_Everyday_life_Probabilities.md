Identify 3 scenarios in your everyday life where you use probability.

Scenario 1: As a delivery driver, I use probability to determine the odds of getting a tip on a delivery. We can get tips either in cash, on 
a credit card, or both. 

Scenario 2: I use probability to forecast the weather so I dress appropriately for the work day and 
whether or not I should bring an umbrealla

Scenario 3: Let's do a simple one. I play NBA 2K20, so a simple example of probability would be whether or not I make a basket

Using the formula you learned to calculate probabilities, 
approximate the probabilities of the events in each of those 3 scenarios.

Let's break down scenario 1 shall we? 
So given a credit card, what is the probability of getting a tip on that delivery. Well this has so many factors, such as
the address or area the delivery is coming from, if it is in a nicer area, then the probability increases that you will get
a tip. But generally speaking, you have a 50 percent chance of getting a tip or not getting a tip. But time of day, day of the 
week, weather, area, and the person ordering all determine getting a tip or not.

So we will call A getting a tip
B is not getting a tip
P(A) = 1/2; P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Scenario 2: checking the weather to prepare myself for the work day. Let's take this week for example. It has been raining in my area 
the past 2 days and storming. Currently there is a 45% chance of raining through 1pm. But where does that 45% come from?
Well it is based off of historical databases, which have similar characteristics of temperature, humidity, and pressure.
So, basically, 45 out of 100 similar days in the past, it has rained.

Scenario 3: It is a 50% chance of making a shot or not generally speaking. But, am I being guarded, what is my stamina at, how
is my focusing, am i really trying or not all factor in.

Think about what potential dependencies the events in each of your 3 scenarios have. 
Calculate the joint probabilities for the events and their dependencies.

Joint probability is a statistical measure that calculates the likelihood of two events occurring together and at the same 
point in time. Joint probability is the probability of event Y occurring at the same time that event X occurs

In scenario 1 the probability of getting a tip and not getting a tip occurring at the same time is impossible

Scenario 2 the probability of it raining and not raining occuring at the same point in time is also impossible.

Scenario 3 the probability of making a shot and not making a shot occuring at the same point in time is once again, 
impossible.

Calculate the conditional probabilities for the events given their dependencies.

Conditional probability is the probability of one event occurring with some relationship to one or more other events. 

Scenario 1: Event A that I get a tip and there is a 50% chance of getting a tip
or I do not get a tip and there is a 50% chance of not getting a tip
or I get a tip and there is a 50 percent chance that I do not get a tip, etc.

Scenario 2: For example: Event A is that it is raining outside, 
and it has a 0.3 (30%) chance of raining today.

Scenario 3: Event A is that I make the shot, and I have a 50 percent chance of either making it or missing it

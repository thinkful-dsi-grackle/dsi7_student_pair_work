Explain the difference between an experiment and a trial. 

An experiment is a repeatable series of events used to test a hypothesis.
A trial is a single instance of the experiment. 

Explain the difference between an outcome and an event. 

Outcomes are what we observe after a completion of a trial. 
An event observes those outcomes and serves as a reflection of what those outcomes are. 

Come up with a real world example of each perspective of probability (classical, empirical, and subjective) 
that was not mentioned in class. 

classical:
	
	Assuming you have a number of equally common objects, 
one can presume that the likelihood of acquiring one object at random would be 
one out of the total number types of objects.
	For example if a child were to acquire a McDonald's happy meal 
with one toy out of a collection of seven, the likelihood of the child receiving a specific of the seven characters 
available would be one in seven. 

empirical:
	
	The McDonald's corporation has decided that they no longer care about toy diversity. 
	The amount of characters shipped to any given McDonalds' varies. We take a sample of the toys
of toys received by children in multiple locations and determine the likelihood that the child will
recieve a specific character based on their location. 
	
subjective:
	With the Covid19 crisis, we rely on subject matter experts with regards to how the disease is spread and the probabily of catching the virus.
For example, it has been mentioned by experts that the wearing of masks can reduce the can reduce transmission by 100% - that is; one can spend a total of 
20 minutes in contact with a person who is infected - if both are wearing masks - as opposed to ten minutes if neither. 

Explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. 
	Descriptive statistics is a way of explaining what has happened, whereas; inferential statistics provides a prediction based on probability.

Explain the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics
	Difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics is that the frequentist example will not adjust it's probability measurement to account for the extremes.
	For example in a coin toss probability measure, the answer will be 50% heads, 50% tails. 
In a Bayesian example a coint toss probability would measure as something like 49.9999%, heads 
49.9999% tails.
0.0002% on its side.

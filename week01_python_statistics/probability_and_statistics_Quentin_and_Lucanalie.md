Explain the difference between an experiment and a trial.
An experiment is a repeatable procedure with a set of well-defined possible results, such as rolling a die or flipping a coin.
A trial is a single performance of an experiment, such as rolling a die once

Explain the difference between an outcome and an event.
An outcome is the result of a trail, for example, rolling a three on a single die. 
An event is one or more outcomes of interest in the sample space, such as two fours rolled in a row or 
an even number was rolled.

Come up with a real world example of each perspective of probability (classical, empirical, and subjective) 
that was not mentioned in class.

An example of classical probability would be guessing on a test.

An example of empirical probability would be you could toss a coin 100 times to see how 
many heads you get, or you could perform a taste test to see if 100 people preferred cola A or cola B.

An example of subjective probability would be Guesstimate that you budget $300 to cover some bill.

Explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics.

Basically descriptive statistics describes and summarizes a data set and inferential statistics is 
learning about a population from a sample of data.

Explain the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics.
Frequentist statistics is probability representing the frequency with which something happens.

Bayesian statistics is how probabilities represent uncertainty.

# Prob_Assignment Tarrant and Alejandro

## Explain the difference between an experiment and a trial.
##### An experiment is the repetition of a procedure that can be infinitely
##### and the possible outcomes are known. However, a trail is just single
##### performance of the experiment.

---

## Explain the difference between an outcome and an event.
##### Outcome is the result of random experiment. However, 
##### an event is just a set of outcomes.

## Come up with a real world example of each perspective of probability 
## (classical, empirical, and subjective) that was not mentioned in class.
##### classical probability: tossing a coin knowing that the likelihood is 50%
##### empirical probability: performing a taste test to see if 300 people prefer
#####                        product A of product B.
##### subjective probability: guessing that a soccer team will win the UEFA because
#####                         it won the league on their country.

## Explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics.
##### Descriptive explains what has happend while inferential predict what will happend

## Explain the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics.
##### In frequentist, only repeatable events have a probability. However, Bayesian
##### states that all events have a probability and that uncertainty can be explains
##### with probability.

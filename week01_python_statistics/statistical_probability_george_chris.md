1. Explain the difference between an experiment and a trial.

An experiment is multiple trials where as a trial is just a singular occurrence.



2. Explain the difference between an outcome and an event.

An event is multiple outcomes where as an outcome is just the result of a single trial.



3. Come up with a real world example of each perspective of probability (classical, empirical, and subjective) that was not mentioned in class.

An example of classical probability is rock paper scissors.
An example of empirical probability are the shooting percentages of basketball players.
An example of subjective probability is the chance of rain in a weather forecast.    


4. Explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics.

Descriptive statistics is only for the sampled population where as inferential statistics reflects the result of the sample onto the whole population.


5. Explain the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics.

In bayesian statistics, every result affects the next outcome where as in frequentist statistics, every outcome is independent of each other.

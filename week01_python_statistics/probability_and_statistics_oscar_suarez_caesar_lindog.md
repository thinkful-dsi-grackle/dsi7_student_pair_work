1) Explain the difference between an experiment and a trial.

The difference between an experiment and a trial is that an experiment is a procedure that is outlined to be a repeatable process and a trial is one instance of the experiment

2) Explain the difference between an outcome and an event.

The difference between an outcome and an event is that the outcome is the result of a trial and an event is a subset of the sample space

3) Come up with a real world example of each perspective of probability (classical, empirical, and subjective) that was not mentioned in class.

Classical - The marbles experiment -- where a certain number of marbles of different colors are put inside a bag. The probability of drawing a certain color is classical statistics.

Empirical - The number of iPhone users vs. the number of total smart phone users.

Subjective - You think you have an 80% chance of your best friend calling today, because her car broke down yesterday and she'll probably need a ride


4) Explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics.

Descriptive statistics is a summary of a data set and infererntial statistics is using probability to make meaningful predictions about a population.

5) Explain the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics.

Frequentist statistics bases itself on the probability of how frequent an event occurs based on sample data. Bayesian revolves around probabilties and uncertainties based on past events.

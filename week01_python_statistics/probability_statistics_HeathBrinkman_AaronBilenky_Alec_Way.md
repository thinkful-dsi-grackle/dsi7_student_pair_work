Probability and Statistics

1. Explain the difference between an experiment and a trial.
An experiment can contain trials, i.e. a trial is one "run" of the experiment. An experiment is a repeatable procedure with a set of well-defined possible results.

2. Explain the difference between an outcome and an event.
An outcome is a single result, but an event can be made up of several outcomes. So a trial can result in, for example, a heads coming up on a coin flip. This would be an outcome. If three heads come up in a row, this is an event. 

3. Come up with a real world example of each perspective of probability (classical, empirical, and subjective) that was not mentioned in class.

The lottery would be a good example to talk about the classical perspective on probability. The chance of winning is directly proportional to the number of tickets bought, so there are two outcomes (win/lose) and the total sample space is made up of everyone who bought tickets. 

The empirical perspective on probability uses past expereince to build probabilities based on incomplete information. The likelihood of someone working in tech driving a tesla would be easy to determine based on a sampling of cars that tech workers drive. 

The likelihood of yellowstone erupting would be best analyzed through a subjective perspective on probability. We have information about other volcanoes, geological data on the area, etc. but it has not erupted and the variables affecting that likelihood are large and varied. 


4. Explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics.

Descriptive statistics summarize data. They show central tendencies, simplify the data, show variable relationships, gives an overview of the data set. Inferential statistics attempt to show information about a population based on a sample of that population. The assumption is that the sample is somewhat representative of the population as a whole, and by analyzing the sample, inferences can be made about the population. 

5. Explain the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics.

Frequentist statistics are based on the idea that probability is based on the frequency of events. Draws conclusions from the sample, and models based on probability but the parameters are not updated. Bayesian statistics model uncertainty, and the models are updated based on new information. The data and the parameters are modeled, whereas frequentist statistics only update the data predictions.
